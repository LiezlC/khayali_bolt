## How the Content Management Works

### The Simple Approach
Instead of complex CMS systems or databases, this site uses **simple JavaScript arrays** in each page component. This means:
- ✅ No database to manage
- ✅ No complex deployment pipelines
- ✅ No broken API connections
- ✅ Everything is self-contained and predictable
- ✅ You can see exactly what's happening
- ✅ Interactive content loads directly in the interface

### Content Structure
Each content item is a JavaScript object with properties like:
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "Your Content Title",
  description: "Brief description of the content",
  category: "Content Category",
  type: "Content Type",
  date: "2025-01-06",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  url: "/path/to/content",
  featured: true, // Optional: shows in featured sections
  duration: "Interactive" // For multimedia/interactive content
}
```

### Interactive Content Integration
The website includes a built-in content viewer that can display:
- **HTML files**: Interactive experiences, dashboards, manifestos
- **Markdown files**: Articles, documentation, protocols
- **Interactive tools**: Kaleidoscope drawing, consciousness explorations
- **Professional content**: ESG dashboards, AI augmentation visions
